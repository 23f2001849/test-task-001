**Project Overview**

This project is designed to demonstrate a simple web application that fulfills the basic requirement of displaying a "Hello, World!" message on the webpage. The purpose of this project is to create a minimalistic yet fully functional, responsive and professional-quality web application. This exercise serves as a foundation stone for any beginner trying to understand the basic structure and functioning of a web application. The task involves using Bootstrap for styling the webpage which introduces the user to one of the most widely used front-end frameworks. The context here is to create a basic application, understand the structure and functioning of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while incorporating the Bootstrap framework.

**Requirements**

The only evaluation criterion for this project is whether the page displays the "Hello, World!" message. This criterion ensures that the basic functionality of the web page is met. The page should load successfully without any errors and display the message in a clear, readable format. The user interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, with a design that is responsive and compatible with various devices and screen sizes. The code should be error-free, well-structured and commented where necessary, demonstrating professional coding practices.

**Installation & Setup**

To setup this project, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have a web browser installed on your machine. Any modern browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc., will work.

2. Download the HTML file from the repository.

3. Place the downloaded file in a directory of your choice.

4. You can open the HTML file in two ways:

   - Right-click on the file and choose the Open with option. Select the web browser you wish to use.

   - Open the web browser, go to the File menu, and select Open File. Navigate to the directory where you saved the HTML file and open it.

5. The web page should now display in your browser.

**Usage Instructions**

Using this web application is straightforward. Once you have the HTML file opened in your chosen browser, you should see a page with a heading displaying the "Hello, World!" message. The page has been designed to be responsive, so it should display correctly regardless of the device or screen size you are using. There are no additional features or user interactions implemented on this page, as the purpose of the project is to demonstrate a simple, functional web page.

**Technical Details**

The web application uses HTML5 for the basic structure of the web page. Bootstrap 5, a widely used front-end framework, is used for the styling of the page. The page is designed to be responsive, meaning it will adjust its layout depending on the screen size of the device viewing it. This is achieved using Bootstrap's responsive design features. The HTML file includes a link to the Bootstrap CSS file, and a script tag at the end of the body includes the Bootstrap JavaScript file. This project does not include any custom JavaScript code, as it's not necessary for the functionality of this particular application.

**Troubleshooting**

If the "Hello, World!" message does not display when you open the HTML file in your browser, check the following:

1. Ensure that you have a stable internet connection, as the Bootstrap files are linked from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).

2. Try opening the HTML file in a different web browser. Some older browsers may not fully support HTML5 or Bootstrap.

3. Make sure that the HTML file is not corrupted or incomplete. If you suspect it might be, try downloading it again from the repository.
